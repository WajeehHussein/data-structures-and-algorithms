# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other.

The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

Linked list is linear data structures, which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
### Challenge Type: New Implementation

1. create node
2. linked list
3. insert nodes
4. search in linked list
5. test some cases

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
create a node class then create a linked list class then add methods (insert,includes and toString) at finally test file.
